If using a fork, note that there is a hard coded URL for the "files" modal referring to this repository in main.js that would need to be updated.

Information for Future Contributors - this is for if you do not have git desktop:

1. Open terminal (In spotlight search type 'terminal')
2. Ensure that git is installed (in terminal type 'git version'. If git is installed, it will show version, if not you can install using https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
3. If installed, navigate to the location you want to store your code in (ex. 'cd ~/Desktop')
4. Clone the repository there by typing 'git clone ...' and then copy the link for this repository
5. Navigate into that new folder by tying 'cd improvedfase' or whatever the name of the repository is.  Once you have done this, you should be able to type 'ls' and show the files as displayed in the repository
6. To run locally, type in 'python3 -m http.server 5500' and then in a browser, type 'http://localhost:5500/' into your search bar. The code should be running on that tab.  To exit, either interupt with the keyboard by pressing 'ctrl + c' or by closing the tab.
7. To edit with VS Code, open the editor and drag the folder into it, or by finding that folder in VS Code.

If you would instead like to clone this repository and work on it, or push changes onto this repository directly, please look up instructions on how to do that.
